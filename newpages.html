<h1>25 Heartbreaking Deaths Of The Harry Potter Series</h1>
<table style="width:100%">

<h2>As the series went on, it became clear that the books were going to become more heartbreaking. The death count rose towards the end of the series, and as it did so, it got more and more heartbreaking. Cedric was sad in Goblet of Fire, but then you have Sirius in Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore in Half Blood Prince, and, the events of Deathly Hallows. These are the 25 major deaths of the series, rated by sadness.</h2>
<h2>25. Lord Voldemort (Yay!)</h2>
<h3>Last Words: "Avada Kedavra!"</h3>
<h2>24.Nagini</h2>
<h2>Nagini is just, so, TERRIFING! T-E-R-R-I-F-I-N-G!</h2>
<h3>Last Words: None, she's a snake. Duh.
<h2>23.Bellatrix Lestrange</h2>
<h2>She was happy about killing Sirius Black. #EVIL!</h2>
<h3>Last Words: "What will happen to your children once I've killed you? When Mummy's gone the same way as Freddie?"</h3>
<h2>22. Peter Pettigrew</h2>
<h2>He betrayed Harry's family! And just sayin', he's just gross. I remember thinking the first time I watched the third movie, "Ew."</h2>
<h3>Last Words:"Stand back. Stand away from the door. I am coming in."</h3>
<h2>21.Professer Quirrel</h2>
<h2>He killed unicorns. And, he had Voldemort living on the back of his head. He's not that bad though. I mean, Voldemort forced him to do those things.</h2>
<h3>Last Words:"Master-I cannot hold him-my hands!"</h3>
<h2>20.Gellert Grindelwald</h2>
<h2>I honestly have nothing to say.</h2>
<h3>Last Words: "Kill me, then! You will not win, you cannot win! That wand will never, ever be yours-"</h3>

<h2>18.Gregorovitch The Wandmaker</h2>
<h2>I mean, I'm sure he was nice, but he never really made a big impact on me.</h2>
<h3>Last Words: "I do not know, I never knew, a young man-no-please-PLEASE!"</h3>
<h2>17.Vincent Crabbe</h2>
<h2>He was mean, and he tortured Harry and all the other Gryffindors, but he didn't deserve to <i>die.</i>
<h3>Last Words: "Like it hot, scum?"</h3>
<h2>16.Frank Bryce</h2>
<h2>Poor Frank. He just walked right in the Riddle House, and boom. Dead.</h2>
<h3>Last Words: "My Lord', is it? Well, I don't think much of your manners, my <i>Lord</i>. Turn around and face me like a man, why don't you?"</h3>
<h2>15.Charity Burbage</h2>
<h2>Meh, she was ok. I mean her death was sad, but meh.</h2>
<h3>Last Words: "Severus... please...please..."</h3>
<h2>14.Bathilda Bagshot</h2>

<h2>12.Cedric Diggory</h2>
<h2>The Tri-Wizard Tournament was terrible when Cedric never made it out.</h2>
