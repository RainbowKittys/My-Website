<h1>Hello, World</h1>
<br>
 <h2>I am here to teach you about the <b>HUMONGOUS</b> importance of Harry Potter.</h2>
    <h2>First Lesson: Harry Potter is AMAZING!</h2>
    <h2>Third Lesson: ..... Uh... Ugh! I have <i>no idea</i> what to type. I am <i>so bored</i>, but I'm not bored at the <i>same time!</i> Does that make sense?</h2>
    <h2>Even if it doesn't, you probably want to read about Harry Potter, not me babbling on and on and on and on and o.... okay I'll stop now.</h2>
    <h2>(Btw, I am a world class champion on being weird.)</h2>
    <h2>From now on I will just talk about random weird stuff.</h2>
    <h2>So...</h2>
    <h1>Cats!!</h1>
<h2>OMG!! Cats are just so cute and fluffy and adorable! They, are, like, the fluffiest animals on earth! Or maybe not i don't really know.</h2>
<h2>K...now....</h2>
<h1>Pandas!!</h1>
<h2>Pandas are very, very, cute and fluffy and they are my absolute favorite animal ever!</h2>
<h2>Why am I just so bored right now even though I'm talking about Harry Potter, Cats, and Pandas?!</h2>
<h2>Okay I will just have to deal with my boredom cause you people probably want to read about me being weird</h2>
<h2>(Or maybe not I don't really care so hahah!)</h2>
<h2>Wait for it...</h2>
<h2>A List!!..About Food!</h2>
<h2>1.Spaghetti</h2>
<h2>2.Pizza</h2>
<h1>And...</h1>
<h1>Dogs!!</h1>
<h2>Dogs are so cute and fuzzy!! They are so adorable!</h2>
<h2>I'm running out of things to talk about, I guess I'll just have to skip to the Harry Potter Death List.
<h2>But if you haven't read/watched all the Harry Potter movies and books then you are in for some spoilers.</h2>
<h2>I dare you not to click the button... No! Don't do it!.. Come on!</h2>
